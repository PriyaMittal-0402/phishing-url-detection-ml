# phishing-url-detection-ml
Machine learning–based phishing URL detection system using feature engineering and classification models, deployed with Flask for real-time analysis.
#  Phishing URL Detection System (Machine Learning)

## Overview
This project is a machine learning–based phishing URL detection system designed to identify malicious URLs in real time.  
It uses feature engineering and classification models to analyze URL patterns and detect phishing attempts, and is deployed using a Flask web application.

## Problem Statement
